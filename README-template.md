## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
Started with a mobile first workflow then changed the design for desktop at the media query.  Used Flexbox to center the main content and changed the direction to row-reverse for the desktop view.  Another challenge was keeping the image aspect ratio the same using width and height 100%.  Used mix-blend-mode to create a filter effect on the black and white images.  Used two images but having one displayed and the other hidden with display: none and swapping them at the media query.
