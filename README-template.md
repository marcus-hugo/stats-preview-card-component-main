## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
Starting with a mobile first workflow then changing the design to desktop at the media query.  Using Flexbox to center the main content and changing the direction to row-reverse for desktop view with a media query.  Another challenge was to keep the image aspect ratio using width and height 100%.  Implementing mix-blend-mode to create a filter effect on the black and white image.  Using two images but having one displayed and the other hidden with display: none and swapping them at the media query.
